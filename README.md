# 0x4447-Product-S3-Email

This stack is for those that want a free way to receive and send emails for their custom domains. Ideal when it is not worth paying a on-line service to have an email that you are going to use sporadically, and could care less about all the features that comes with that payed service. Also, ideal for developer to have test emails.

> just receive and send email with some skills.

# How to deploy

# Manual work

When you deploy this stack not everything is going be done for you. One missing aspect is adding your domain that you want to receive your email to SES, and confirm that you own it. This is due to CloudFomariont not supporting 100% of what AWS has to offer. To add your domain do the following:

1. Go to the SES Dashboard.
1. On the left side menu click `Domains`.
1. Click the blue button `Verify a New Domain`.
1. In the modal type your domain and select `Generate DKIM Settings`.
1. In the next window you will have all the information needed to configure your domain.
1. Once done you have to wait some time for the domain to switch from a status of `pending verification` to `verified`.

After the domain is confirmed you will be able to send emails from any email address within your domain.

# What will be deployed

This stack takes advantage of AWS S3, AWS SES, AWS Lambda and the AWS Trigger system to tie everything together.

- **SES**: is responsible for receiving and sending emails.
- **S3 Bucket**: is used to store the messages.
- **Lambda**: is used to process the emails.

# How dose it work

**Intake**:

1. an email comes to SES which will trigger a Lambda function.
1. this lambda function will sort the email based on the To and From field and store it in S3 under the `inbox` folder
1. the `inbox` folder will trigger a Lambda function which will load the raw email, convert it in to a `.html` file, and store it along side the original message.

**Outtake**:

1. You create a JSON file properly formatted (check the section bellow)
1. Save it in to the `_outbound` folder
1. The `_outbound` folder will trigger a Lambda which will read the JSON file and create a raw email which will be saved in the `to_be_sent` folder.
1. the `to_be_sent` folder will trigger a Lambda which will take the raw email and send it using SES while moving the message to the `Sent` folder.
1. the `Sent` folder will trigger the same Lambda that processes the raw emails to create a `.html` file.

# How to make the email message

You create a custom JSON file which you then upload to the `_outbound` folder, and the file should look like this:

```
{
	"From": "name@example.com",
	"To": "name@example.com",
	"Title": "Nice email title.",
	"Body": "Write a nice message to whoever you are sending this message to."
}

```

Remember that the `From` field must use the domain that you added to SES, you won't be able to send email from domains that you did not verified.

# SES Limitation

For security reasons AWS by default allows you to send 200 emails per 24 hour period with a rate of 1 email/second. If you think you'll send more then that, you'll have to ask AWS to increase your limit.

# Pricing

All the resources deployed with this stack will potentially cost you money. But for this to happen you'll have to:

- Invoke your lambdas over 1,000,000 times a month
- Send and receive over 1000 emails a month
- Perform over 10000 Get and Put operations, and over 2000 Delete ones.

The only payment that you'll encounter is S3 storage for the emails that you receive and create.

# How to work with this project

If you'd like to change some aspects of this stack, don't edit the `CloudFormation.json` file. We recommend you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes). This tool was designed to make it easier to work with Cloud Formation file. You should never edit the main CF file.
