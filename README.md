# 0x4447-Product-S3-Email

This stack was created out of frustration due to the fact that to this day there's no easy way to have a full email server without the overhead of installing and configuring all servers needed to handle incoming and outgoing messages. We wanted something simple, with no interface and no server management, so we came up with S3-Email. This included AWS SES as our email server (receive and send) and S3 as our database and interface. Then we tied everything together with a bit of code via AWS Lambda.

The result is an unmanaged email server with unlimited email addresses that also offers the benefit of easily organizing messages by adding the `+` character to the email names. The `+` is converted to a `/`, which correlates to an object path in S3.

### Organizing with a +

When you sign up for online services, organize your emails with the `+` character in this way:

- social+facebook@example.com
- social+instagram@example.com
- social+linkedin@example.com

This groups all social emails in the `Social` folder. The possibilities are endless.

### Endless email addresses

Once you add and confirm your domain with SES, you can put any string you want in front of the `@`, as long as it conforms to the email address standard. This means that you'll have endless email addresses at your disposal, and you'll be able to organize your life in any way you want. For example, you can give each service you sign up for its own special email:

- facebook@example.com
- instagram@example.com
- linkedin@example.com

This allows you to use some skill in receiving and sending email messages.

# DISCLAIMER!

This stack is available to anyone at no cost, but on an as-is basis. 0x4447 LLC is not responsible for damages or costs of any kind that may occur when you use the stack. You take full responsibility when you use it.

# How to deploy

All you need to do to deploy this stack is click the button the left and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard.

# What will deploy?

![S3-Email Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447-product-s3-email/assets/diagram.png)

The stack takes advantage of AWS S3, AWS SES, AWS Lambda, and the AWS Trigger system to tie everything together. You'll get:

- 1x SES Rule Sets
- 2x S3 Bucket
  - 1x for CodePipeline to store artifacts
  - 1x for the emails
- 3x CodePipelines
- 6x CodeBuilds
- 3x Lambdas

All project resources can be found [here](https://github.com/0x4447?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=0x4447-product-s3-email).

# Auto deploy

The stack is set up in a such a way that any time new code is pushed to a selected branch, the CodePipeline picks up the change and updates the Lambda for you. These are the available branches:

- **master**: the latest stable code
- **development**: unstable code that we test in our test environment - we don't recommend that you use this branch

# Manual work

Keep in mind that when you deploy, everything may not work right out of the box.

### Confirm that you own the domain

You have to add your domain and confirm that you own it. Follow these steps to do so:

1. Go to the SES Dashboard.
2. Click `Domains` on the left side menu.
3. Click the blue `Verify a New Domain` button.
4. Type your domain in the modal and select `Generate DKIM Settings`.
5. The next window displays all information needed to configure your domain.
6. Once finisheds, you'll wait some time for the domain to switch from a `pending verification` status to a `verified` status.

### Enable SES Rule Sets

Deployment creates SES `rule sets`. This should be enabled by default, but it doesn't always happen because of a known bug in CloudFormation. Taking the following steps will enable the rule:

1. Go to the SES Dashboard.
2. Click `Rule Sets` on the left side menu.
3. Check `0x4447_S3_Email` on the `Inactive Rule Sets` tab.
4. Hit `Set as Active Rule Set` to activate the rule.

# SES Limitations

There are two major limitations with SES:

1. For security reasons, AWS defaults to 200 emails sent per 24 hour period at a rate of 1 email/second. If you need to send more than that, you'll need to ask AWS to increase your limit.
2. By default, you can't send emails to unverified addresses. If you'd like to be able to send (as opposed to just receiving), you'll need to reach out to AWS to remove this limitation from your account.

# How the stack works

**Receiving email**:

1. An email comes to SES and triggers a Lambda function.
2. The Lambda function sorts the email based on the `To` and `From` fields and stores it in the `Inbox` folder under S3.
3. The `Inbox` folder triggers another Lambda function that loads the raw email, converts it to a `.html` and `.txt` file, and stores it alongside the original message.

**Sending email**:

1. Create a properly formatted JSON file (see the following section).
2. Save the file to the path `TMP/email_out/json`. The file name and extension are irrelevant as long as the content is text and JSON formatted.
3. This action triggers a Lambda that generates a raw email, sends it out using SES, and saves the raw message to the `Sent` folder.
4. The `Sent` folder triggers another Lambda function that loads the raw email, converts it to a `.html` and `.txt` file, and stores it alongside the original message.

This flow was designed to take advantage of the S3 trigger system and break each action into a small Lambda.

### How to create an email message

Create a custom JSON file, then upload it to the `TMP/email_out/json` folder (if you don't have the folder structure yet, set it up). The JSON structure should look like this:

```
{
	`from`: `name@example.com`,
	`to`: `name@example.com`,
	`subject`: `From SES`,
	`html`: `Write a nice message to whoever you are sending this message to.`,
	`text`: `Write a nice message to whoever you are sending this message to.`
}
```

Remember that the `From` field must contain the domain you added to SES. You won't be able to send emails from unverified domains.

# Pricing

All resources deployed via this stack will potentially cost you money. But you'd have to do the following for this to happen:

- Invoke Lambdas over 1,000,000 times a month
- Send and receive over 1000 emails a month
- Perform over 10,000 Get and Put operations and over 2000 Delete operations in your S3 Bucket
- Exceed 100 build minutes on CodeBuild
- $1 per active CodePipeline (must run at least once a month to be considered active)

The only payment you'll encounter from Day One is an S3 storage fee for emails and CodePipeline artifacts.

# How to work with this project

When you want to deploy the stack, the only file you should be interested in is the `CloudFormation.json` file. If you'd like to modify the stack, we recommend that you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes), which was designed to make it easier to work with the CloudFormation file. If you'd like to keep your sanity, never edit the main CF file ðŸ¤ª.
