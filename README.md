# 0x4447-Product-S3-Email

This stack is for those that want a free way to receive and send emails for their custom domains with the additional benefit of being able to organize the incoming emails with a simple `+` character. This stack is deal for:

- individuals that have some technical skills,
- developers that need test emails.
- or organizations that want to give emails to thousands of employees at scale (you'll need to build your own UI).

In addition, this solution will help you organize your emails in a way never seen before thanks to this two features:

### Organizing with a +

You can organize your emails with the `+` character. For example: when you sign up for on-line services you could write the following email: social+facebook@example.com, or social+instagram@example.com, or social+linkedin@example.com. By doing so all your social emails will be grouped in the `social` folder. The possibilities are endless.

### Endless email addresses

Once you add and confirm your domain with SES you can put in front of the `@` any sting you want (that conform with the email address standard). This means you have endless email addresses to organize your life however you want. And on top of that, with the `+` character you'll never need to crated tedious filters to organize your emails or pay unnecessary money for something so basic like an inbox.

> Just receive and send email with some skills.

# How to deploy

<a target="_blank" href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/new?stackName=0x4447-S3-Email&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/0x4447-drive-cloudformation/s3-email.json">
<img align="left" style="float: left; margin: 0 10px 0 0;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png"></a>

To deploy this stack just click the button to the left, and follow the instructions that CloudFormation provides in your AWS Dashboard.

# What will be deployed

![S3-Email Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x4447/0x4447-product-s3-email/assets/diagram.png)

This stack takes advantage of AWS S3, AWS SES, AWS Lambda and the AWS Trigger system to tie everything together.

- 1x SES Rule Sets
- 2x S3 Bucket
  - 1x for CodePipeline to store artifacts
  - 1x for the emails
- 3x CodePipelines
- 6x CodeBuilds
- 3x Lambdas

Once deployed the code for the Lambdas will be automatically updated, and the CodePipeline will keep the Lambda code up-to-date since it will push new code every time the selected brunch gets new code.

All the resources of the project can be found [here](https://github.com/0x4447?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=0x4447-product-s3-email).

# Manual work

When you deploy this stack not everything is going be done for you.

### Confirm you own the domain

To add your domain do the following:

1. Go to the SES Dashboard.
1. On the left side menu click `Domains`.
1. Click the blue button `Verify a New Domain`.
1. In the modal type your domain and select `Generate DKIM Settings`.
1. In the next window you will have all the information needed to configure your domain.
1. Once done you have to wait some time for the domain to switch from a status of `pending verification` to `verified`.

After the domain is confirmed you will be able to send emails from any email address within your domain.

### Enable SES Rule Sets

The deployment will create a SES rules set which should be enabled by default, but because of a know bug in CloudFormation, this dose not always happen. To enable the rule, do the following:

1. Go to the SES Dashboard.
1. On the left side menu click `Rule Sets`.
1. From the `Inactive Rule Sets` tab check the `0x4447_S3_Email`
1. Then hit `Set as Active Rule Set` which will activate the rule.

Once this is done, you will be able to process incoming emails.

# How dose it work

**Receiving an email**:

1. An email comes to SES which will trigger a Lambda function.
1. This lambda function will sort the email based on the To and From field and store it in S3 under the `Inbox` folder.
1. The `Inbox` folder will trigger a Lambda function which will load the raw email, convert it in to a `.html` and `.txt` file, and store it along side the original message.

**Sending an email**:

1. You create a JSON file properly formatted (check the section bellow)
1. Save the file in the following path `TMP/email_out/json`. The file name or extension are irrelevant as long as the content is text and JSON formated.
1. This action will trigger the `outbound` Lambda which will generate a raw email, send it out using SES and save the raw message to the `Sent` folder.
1. The `Sent` folder will trigger a Lambda function which will load the raw email, convert it in to a `.html` and `.txt` file, and store it along side the original message.

This flow was designed to take only advantage of the S3 trigger system, and brake each action in to small Lambda.

### How to make the email message

You create a custom JSON file which you then upload to the `TMP/email_out/json` folder, and the file should look like this:

```
{
	"from": "name@example.com",
	"to": "name@example.com",
	"subject": "From SES",
	"html": "Write a nice message to whoever you are sending this message to.",
	"text": "Write a nice message to whoever you are sending this message to."
}
```

Remember that the `from` field must use the domain that you added to SES, you won't be able to send emails from domains that you did not verify.

# SES Limitation

There are two major limitation with SES:

1. For security reasons AWS by default allows you to send 200 emails per 24 hour period with a rate of 1 email/second. If you think you'll send more then that, you'll have to ask AWS to increase your limit.
1. By default you can't send emails to unverified addresses. If you want the ability to send out (not only receive), you'll have to reach out to AWS to remove this limitation from your account.

# Pricing

All the resources deployed with this stack will potentially cost you money. But for this to happen you'll have to:

- Invoke your lambdas over 1,000,000 times a month.
- Send and receive over 1000 emails a month.
- Perform over 10000 Get and Put operations, and over 2000 Delete ones in your S3 Bucket.
- Exceed 100 build minutes on CodeBuild
- $1 per active CodePipeline. A CodePipeline needs to run at least once a month to be considered active.

The only payment that you'll encounter from day one, is S3 storage for the emails and CodePipeline artifacts.

# How to work with this project

If you'd like to change some aspects of this stack, don't edit the `CloudFormation.json` file. We recommend you use the [Grapes framework](https://github.com/0x4447/0x4447-cli-node-grapes). This tool was designed to make it easier to work with Cloud Formation file. You should never edit the main CF file.
